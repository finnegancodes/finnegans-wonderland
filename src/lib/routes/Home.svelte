      Uhh, I wanted to record a message for you; to let you know I'm obssesed
      with FNAF, and had to turn this intro into a crappy phone guy reference.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hmm, let's see. First, I should introduce myself. I'm Finnegan (he/they),
      and I'm an IT student who's also a beginner web developer. Key word —
      <span class="underline">beginner</span> — I really don't know what I'm doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      This site will be used — aside from trashy FNAF references — as a place to
      share my projects, which will mostly consist of web stuff, and as a way to
      express my opinions; through the <span class="underline">blog</span> section
      (coming soon).
    </p>

    <p>
      If you — for any reason — are looking for ways to contact me, the <span
        class="underline">contact</span
      > section might have some useful information for you. I'm open to talking to
      anyone, so don't be shy.
    </p>
    <p>That's about it, have fun exploring my site!</p>
